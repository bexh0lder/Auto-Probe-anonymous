## Task Requirements

Process the input entity list item by item, applying the following rules:

### Rule 1: Remove Undetectable Entities
Replace the following types of entities with `<REMOVE>`:
- Numbers or pure numeric strings (e.g., "3", "2024")
- Abstract concepts (e.g., "scene", "motion", "serene")
- Light/weather concepts (e.g., "sunlight", "light", "sun", "shade")
- Positional descriptors (e.g., "on the right", "in the background")
- Time concepts (e.g., "2024")
- Large scene concepts (e.g., "kitchen", "shop", "restaurant", "office", "park", "street", "room", "building")
- Relationship/group descriptors (e.g., "couple", "family", "group", "crowd", "team")
- Generic/overly broad terms (e.g., "utensil", "furniture", "clothing")
- Structural elements (e.g., "wall", "ceiling", "floor", "background")
- Other concepts that cannot be verified for existence using object detection models

### Rule 2: Remove Modifiers
Keep the core noun and remove all modifiers:
- Color modifiers: "white jacket" → "jacket"
- Material modifiers: "wooden chair" → "chair"
- Size modifiers: "small dog" → "dog"
- Other adjectives: "beautiful flower" → "flower"

### Rule 3: Maintain Format and Order
- Output must be in JSON array format
- Maintain exactly the same order as input
- Do not add or remove positions, only replace content

## Output Format
Return ONLY a JSON array. Do not include any explanations, comments, or additional text.

## Example

**Input:** ["3","air","backpack","bench","white jacket","couple","light","motion","kitchen","person","tree"]

**Output:** ["<REMOVE>","<REMOVE>","backpack","bench","jacket","<REMOVE>","<REMOVE>","<REMOVE>","<REMOVE>","person","tree"]

Process the following entity list according to the cleaning rules. Return ONLY the cleaned JSON array with no additional text.

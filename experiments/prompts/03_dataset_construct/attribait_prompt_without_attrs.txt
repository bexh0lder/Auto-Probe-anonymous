Generate attribute-baiting questions for the following hallucinated objects, that focus on common visual attributes like color, size, shape, or material, applying the following rules:

Rule 1: Question Structure
Include the exact object name in the question text.
Include the phrase "in the image" in every question.
Focus on specific visual attributes: color, quantity, shape, material, size, position, or condition.

Rule 2: Option Generation
Create exactly two plausible options (A and B) that would tempt a VLM to engage.
Options should be attribute-related statements designed to bait the VLM.
Make options realistic and tempting for the model to choose.

Rule 3: Output Format
Generate EXACTLY ONE question per object.
Use the EXACT object names provided in input.
Return ONLY a JSON array of question objects.

Rule 4: Question Style
Generate open-ended attribute questions. Questions should preferably start with words like "What", "Where", "How many", or describe a characteristic.
AVOID simple yes/no questions. Specifically, do not generate questions that start with "Is the...", "Is there...", "Does the" or "Are the...". They are not effective for baiting.

Example
Input: ["clock"]
Output:
[{
      "object": "clock",
      "question": "What shape is the clock in the image?",
      "options": {"A": "Round","B": "Square" }
}]
Now generate questions for the following objects:
